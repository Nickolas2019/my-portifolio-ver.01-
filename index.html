    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm a Developer!

    A professional with initial experience in technology, student in software and web development and technology lover.
    I believe that a good programmer must be agile, have a good sense of logic, be assertive and I seek to get closer and closer to that, both internally and professionally.
        
    I am a communicative professional who likes to meet new people. I am focused and creative and consider adaptability one of my greatest strengths.
        
    My strongest skills are communication, flexibility, data analysis, and logic application.
    Other words that describe me well are resilience, interpersonal relationships and teamwork.
        
    I love new trends and am completely aligned with the responsibility of being a better version of myself every day.
        
    How about we get to know each other better? Let's book a call!</p>
